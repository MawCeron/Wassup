# Development

## Requirements

Fedora 44 packages:

```sh
sudo dnf install golang rust cargo rustfmt clippy protobuf-compiler gtk4-devel libadwaita-devel
```

Versions in use: Go 1.26, Rust 1.99, protoc 3.19, GTK 4.22, libadwaita 1.9.
The Fedora toolchains are used instead of `rustup` so development matches
what the RPM is built with.

## Daemon (Go)

Run from `daemon/`:

| Task | Command |
|---|---|
| Build | `go build ./...` |
| Run with request logging | `go run . -debug` |
| Format | `gofmt -w .` |
| Check formatting | `test -z "$(gofmt -l .)"` |
| Static analysis | `go vet ./...` |
| Tests | `go test -race ./...` |

## UI (Rust)

Run from `ui/`:

| Task | Command |
|---|---|
| Build | `cargo build` |
| Format | `cargo fmt` |
| Check formatting | `cargo fmt --check` |
| Static analysis | `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings` |
| Tests | `cargo test` |
| Tests against the Go daemon | `cargo test -- --include-ignored` |

Run the UI with `cargo run` while the daemon is running. The app is
single-instance (`io.github.MawCeron.Wassup`): launching it again only
brings the existing window to the front. An unlinked account shows the
QR code to link it.

Closing the window ends the UI process but not the daemon, which keeps
receiving messages. The window size and the open chat are saved to
`$XDG_STATE_HOME/wassup/ui.ini` and restored on the next launch.

Formatting and lint rules are the tools' defaults; no config files.

## IPC code generation

`proto/ipc.proto` is the single source for both sides.

- **Go:** run `go generate ./...` from `daemon/` after changing the schema,
  and commit `daemon/ipc/ipc.pb.go`. `protoc-gen-go` is pinned as a tool in
  `daemon/go.mod`, so no global install is needed.
- **Rust:** `ui/build.rs` regenerates the types on every `cargo build`
  that sees a schema change; nothing is committed. It needs `protoc` in
  `PATH`.

## Test client

`wassupctl` talks to a running daemon over IPC, so an account can be
linked and used before the UI exists. Run from `daemon/`:

```sh
go run . -debug                            # terminal 1: the daemon
go run ./cmd/wassupctl accounts            # terminal 2: note the account id
go run ./cmd/wassupctl link <account>      # scan the QR with the phone
go run ./cmd/wassupctl watch               # print incoming messages
go run ./cmd/wassupctl send <account> 5215550000000 hello
go run ./cmd/wassupctl chats <account>
go run ./cmd/wassupctl messages <account> 5215550000000
```

`link` draws the QR in the terminal when `qrencode` is installed
(`sudo dnf install qrencode`); otherwise it prints the text to encode.

Use a secondary number: this is an unofficial client.

## Configuration

The daemon reads `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/wassup/config.json` at startup. The
file is optional; every option defaults to off.

```json
{
  "hide_notification_content": true
}
```

| Option | Effect |
|---|---|
| `hide_notification_content` | Notifications show the chat but not the message text. |

An unknown option or a syntax error stops the daemon instead of being
ignored, so a misspelled privacy option cannot silently turn itself off.

Notifications go through `org.freedesktop.Notifications` on the session
bus. Muted chats do not notify, each chat keeps a single notification
that newer messages replace, and reading the chat withdraws it.
